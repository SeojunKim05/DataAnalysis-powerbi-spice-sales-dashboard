# Outlander Spice Sales Analysis

This project uses Power BI to analyze sales data for five spices across different regions and quarters. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard and multiple views to explore trends in total, average, and maximum sales, both overall and region-specific.

  The raw dataset containing sales records categorized by region (Central, East, North, South, West), product (Anise Seeds, Basil Leaf, Cloves, Chives, Cassia), quarter, and sales figures.

- **`Power BI Spice Sales Overall.pdf`**  
  A static PDF export of the Power BI dashboard and reports. This file contains visualizations and dashboards across four pages.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preparation in Excel  
- Power BI data modeling  
- DAX calculations (average, max, sum)  
- Visualization design (bar charts, matrix tables, treemaps, pie & donut charts, slicers, and cards)  
- Dashboard UX focused on clarity and interactivity  

## üìå Notes

Due to licensing changes and the transition to Microsoft Fabric, direct publishing of the interactive dashboard is unavailable. The PDF serves as a visual reference for the interactive report.
